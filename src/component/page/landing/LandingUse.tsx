            84% of today’s consumers think a website makes your business more
            credible than companies who only have social media profiles. Your
            website is also the perfect place to show off any professional
            certifications or awards your business has.

              Your website can attract new customers through Google
            </h2>
            <p class="leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">
              You may be happy with the current size of your business, but every
              company experiences customer turnover. To encourage continued
              success, you need to attract new customers, and one of the best
              ways to do it is by making yourself more visible on Google. Social
              media networks are indexed on Google, and social media posts can
              be found with the search engine, but a website gives you access to
              many more tools and strategies for Search Engine Optimization
              (SEO). And SEO is the key to making your business appear on the
              front page of Google.

              You can show potential customers what they’ll get when they work
              with you by displaying high-quality photography on your website. <br />
              You can also use your website design, along with the featured images, to give people a sense of what it feels like to enter your physical location. This works particularly well if your brand is closely tied to the “feel” of your location, like the Canadian restaurant
